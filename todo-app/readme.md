# Readme

Some design docs for the Solid-Todo-App.

The most important:

- _app-spec.md_

as I try to have it define the app in a normative way.

Maybe useful:

- _minimal-shape.shexc_

Trying to describe the minimal data shape

Less useful:

- _task-turtle-schema-compilation.ttl_
- _task-list-turtle-schema-compilation.ttl_

Invalid Turtle -- butcher it for the Schema.org SPO's.

Historical:

- _potential-app-features.org_

The very first iteration of "thinking about the app feature-set"

TODO:

- SPARQL-queries for default use-cases
- own Todo-App-vocabulary
