# Readme

Some design docs for the Solid-Todo-App.

The most important:

- app-spec.md

as I try to have it define the app in a normative way.

Maybe useful:

- minimal-shape.shexc

Trying to describe the minimal data shape

Less useful:

- task-turtle-schema-compilation.ttl
- task-list-turtle-schema-compilation.ttl

Invalid Turtle -- butcher it for the Schema.org SPO's.

Historical:

- potential-app-features.org 

The very first iteration of "thinking about the app feature-set"

TODO:

- SPARQL-queries for default use-cases
- own Todo-App-vocabulary
